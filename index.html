            <p> Belisa Crepusculario saved her life and in the process accidentally discovered writing. In a village
              near the coast, the wind blew a page of newspaper at her feet. She picked up the brittle yellow paper and
              stood a long while looking at it, unable to determine its purpose, until curiosity overcame her shyness.
              She walked over to a man who was washing his horse in the muddy pool where she had quenched her thirst.
            </p>
            <p> "What is this?" she asked. </p>
            <p> "The sports page of the newspaper," the man replied, concealing his surprise at her ignorance. The
              answer astounded the girl, but she did not want to seem rude, so she merely inquired about the
              significance of the fly tracks scattered across the page. </p>
            <p> "Those are words, child. Here it says that Fulgencio Barba knocked out El Negro Tiznao in the third
              round." </p>
            <p> That was the day Belisa Crepusculario found out that words make their way in the world without a master,
              and that anyone with a little cleverness can appropriate them and do business with them. She made a quick
              assessment of her situation and concluded that aside from becoming a prostitute or working as a servant in
              the kitchens of the rich there were few occupations she was qualified for. It seemed to her that selling
              words would be an honorable alternative. From that moment on, she worked at that profession, and was never
              tempted by any other. At the beginning, she offered her merchandise unaware that words could be written
              outside of newspapers. When she learned otherwise, she calculated the infinite possibilities of her trade
              and with her savings paid a priest twenty pesos to teach her to read and write, with her three remaining
              coins she bought a dictionary. She poured over it from A to Z and then threw it into the sea, because it
              was not her intention to defraud her customers with packaged words. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-text">
            <p> One August morning several years later, Belisa Crepusculario was sitting in her tent in the middle of a
              plaza, surrounded by the uproar of market day, selling legal arguments to an old man who had been trying
              for sixteen years to get his pension. Suddenly she heard yelling and thudding hoofbeats. She looked up
              from her writing and saw, first, a cloud of dust, and then a band of horsemen come galloping into the
              plaza. They were the Colonel's men, sent under orders of El Mulato, a giant known throughout the land for
              the speed of his knife and his loyalty to his chief. Both the Colonel and El Mulato had spent their lives
              fighting in the civil war, and their names were ineradicably linked to devastation and calamity. The
              rebels swept into town like a stampeding herd, wrapped in noise, bathed in sweat, and leaving a hurricane
              of fear in their trail. Chickens took wing, dogs ran for their lives, women and children scurried out of
              sight, until the only living soul left in the market was Belisa Crepusculario. She had never seen El
              Mulato and was surprised to see him walking toward her. </p>
            <p>"I'm looking for you," he shouted, pointing his coiled whip at her, even before the words were out, two
              men rushed her -- knocking over her canopy and shattering her inkwell -- bound her hand and foot, and
              threw her like a sea bag across the rump of El Mulato's mount. Then they thundered off toward the hills.
            </p>
            <p> Hours later, just as Belisa Crepusculario was near death, her heart ground to sand by the pounding of
              the horse, they stopped, and four strong hands set her down. She tried to stand on her feet and hold her
              head high, but her strength failed her and she slumped to the ground, sinking into a confused dream. She
              awakened several hours later to the murmur of night in the camp, but before she had time to sort out the
              sounds, she opened her eyes and found herself staring into the impatient glare of El Mulato, kneeling
              beside her. </p>

          <h1> Two Words: A Formalist Analysis </h1>
          <p> Words—they’re everywhere. Despite how small or invisible they may be, they are powerful tools that can change, that can touch, and that can move the world around you. Isabel Allende’s “Two Words” is a magical realist short story about how Belisa Crepusculario discovered their true potential and managed to thaw even a frozen heart. Under a formalist lens, Allende’s elements of defamiliarization and magical realism work hand in hand to paint how powerful of an influence words are in people’s lives and social systems. </p>

          <p><i> She made a quick assessment of her situation and concluded that aside from becoming a prostitute or working as a servant in the kitchens of the rich there were few occupations she was qualified for. It seemed to her that selling words would be an honorable alternative (p. 2). </i></p>

          <p> Belisa’s words were metaphors—defamiliarizing ‘words’ from an abstract tool for communication to an artisan’s physical craft. She had strived not to use “packaged words” but handpicked, special words. She skillfully stringed together these words that could improve dreams and invent unique insults. This sheds light on how literacy can open up many preferable careers. And like tools of a craft, these words can be powerful instruments that could be used for whatever purpose, both good and bad. Her words brought a spark of light to each little town she visited, such that people would crowd around her tent. </p>

          <p> El Mulato's desire for her had turned into rage, and only his fear of her tongue prevented his cutting her to shreds with his whip. Nor was he inclined to tell her that the Colonel was in a fog, and that a spell whispered into his ear had done what years of battle had not been able to do (p. 7). </i></p>
          
          <p> In El Mulato’s eyes, these words were presented as magical spells that held power over the people’s thoughts. He and his men searched all over the country for her, with intentions of using her words for power and to take control of the palace. When she spoke up to him, he believed that her words were a curse she had put on him. He considered the two words she had given to the Colonel witchcraft. This time, Allende put words in a different light: words are a means to authority and to stand up to authority. </p>
          
          <p><i> They were dazzled by the clarity of the Colonel's proposals and the poetic lucidity of his arguments, infected by his powerful wish to right the wrongs of history, happy for the first time in their lives (p. 6). </i></p>
          
          <p> To the public, to the recipients of her words, the words were defamiliarized by the imagery. They were given an almost dream-like quality. They were glowing and dazzling, with a poetic lucidity to it. They inspired in the people a hope of change and new, proper governance. In addition, the Colonel’s two words inspired in him a certain hope, such that he would murmur them and go daydreaming. </p>
          
          <p> Despite the inherent magical approach of Isabelle Allande in her work, there is some form of truth in the fact that there is power in one’s words. Through this story, she elevates our understanding of words as plain strings of characters to a grander idea of magical tools that bend our notions of the world. It has the power to open up opportunities, to stand up to authority, and to inspire hope. “Two Words” reinforces the role of language as a powerful tool to change people’s lives and to shape someone’s destiny. Furthermore, the words we use have the power to shape someone’s fate. Mysterious as the words can be, even a ferocious and voracious soul can be tamed with simple words. </p>
