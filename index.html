            <p> Belisa Crepusculario saved her life and in the process accidentally discovered writing. In a village
              near the coast, the wind blew a page of newspaper at her feet. She picked up the brittle yellow paper and
              stood a long while looking at it, unable to determine its purpose, until curiosity overcame her shyness.
              She walked over to a man who was washing his horse in the muddy pool where she had quenched her thirst.
            </p>
            <p> "What is this?" she asked. </p>
            <p> "The sports page of the newspaper," the man replied, concealing his surprise at her ignorance. The
              answer astounded the girl, but she did not want to seem rude, so she merely inquired about the
              significance of the fly tracks scattered across the page. </p>
            <p> "Those are words, child. Here it says that Fulgencio Barba knocked out El Negro Tiznao in the third
              round." </p>
            <p> That was the day Belisa Crepusculario found out that words make their way in the world without a master,
              and that anyone with a little cleverness can appropriate them and do business with them. She made a quick
              assessment of her situation and concluded that aside from becoming a prostitute or working as a servant in
              the kitchens of the rich there were few occupations she was qualified for. It seemed to her that selling
              words would be an honorable alternative. From that moment on, she worked at that profession, and was never
              tempted by any other. At the beginning, she offered her merchandise unaware that words could be written
              outside of newspapers. When she learned otherwise, she calculated the infinite possibilities of her trade
              and with her savings paid a priest twenty pesos to teach her to read and write, with her three remaining
              coins she bought a dictionary. She poured over it from A to Z and then threw it into the sea, because it
              was not her intention to defraud her customers with packaged words. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-text">
            <p> One August morning several years later, Belisa Crepusculario was sitting in her tent in the middle of a
              plaza, surrounded by the uproar of market day, selling legal arguments to an old man who had been trying
              for sixteen years to get his pension. Suddenly she heard yelling and thudding hoofbeats. She looked up
              from her writing and saw, first, a cloud of dust, and then a band of horsemen come galloping into the
              plaza. They were the Colonel's men, sent under orders of El Mulato, a giant known throughout the land for
              the speed of his knife and his loyalty to his chief. Both the Colonel and El Mulato had spent their lives
              fighting in the civil war, and their names were ineradicably linked to devastation and calamity. The
              rebels swept into town like a stampeding herd, wrapped in noise, bathed in sweat, and leaving a hurricane
              of fear in their trail. Chickens took wing, dogs ran for their lives, women and children scurried out of
              sight, until the only living soul left in the market was Belisa Crepusculario. She had never seen El
              Mulato and was surprised to see him walking toward her. </p>
            <p>"I'm looking for you," he shouted, pointing his coiled whip at her, even before the words were out, two
              men rushed her -- knocking over her canopy and shattering her inkwell -- bound her hand and foot, and
              threw her like a sea bag across the rump of El Mulato's mount. Then they thundered off toward the hills.
            </p>
            <p> Hours later, just as Belisa Crepusculario was near death, her heart ground to sand by the pounding of
              the horse, they stopped, and four strong hands set her down. She tried to stand on her feet and hold her
              head high, but her strength failed her and she slumped to the ground, sinking into a confused dream. She
              awakened several hours later to the murmur of night in the camp, but before she had time to sort out the
              sounds, she opened her eyes and found herself staring into the impatient glare of El Mulato, kneeling
              beside her. </p>

          <h1> Two Words: A Formalist Analysis </h1>
          <p>
            Words—they’re everywhere. Despite how small or invisible they may be, they are powerful tools that can
            change, that can touch, and that can move the world around you. Isabel Allende’s “Two Words” is a magical
            realist short story about how Belisa Crepusculario discovered their true potential and managed to thaw even
            a frozen heart. Under a formalist lens, Allende’s elements of defamiliarization and magical realism work
            hand in hand to paint how powerful of an influence words are in people’s lives and social systems.</p>

          <p> The unique ‘words’ that Belisa gave to each person was used as a metaphor to defamiliarize ‘words’ as
            solely a tool for communication, and they were elevated as tools for giving a sense of purpose in each of
            the person’s unique lives. Words can usher people in reaching their destiny, into changing their lives for
            the better or for the worse. </p>

          <p> Allende says, “It was not the same word for everyone, naturally, because that would have been collective
            deceit. Each person received his or her own word, with the assurance that no one else would use it that way
            in this universe or the Beyond.” (TWO WORDS, 1989, p.1). </p>

          <p> “She poured over it from A to Z and then threw it into the sea, because it was not her intention to
            defraud her customers with packaged words.”(TWO WORDS, 1989, p.3). </p>

          <p> Belisa’s discovery of writing was used as a metaphor to defamiliarize that ‘words’ are just a simple
            conversation instrument. Now ‘words’ are conveyed as a powerful instrument of hope and survival, yet could
            also be used as a powerful instrument for despair and downfall. It explores how words have transformative
            power and could give infinite chances to trade for your future. </p>

          <p> From that moment on, she worked at that profession, and was never tempted by any other. At the beginning,
            she offered her merchandise unaware that words could be written outside of newspapers. When she learned
            otherwise, she calculated the infinite possibilities of her trade and with her savings paid a priest twenty
            pesos to teach her to read and write, with her three remaining coins she bought a dictionary.”(TWO WORDS,
            1989, pp.2-3). </p>

          <p> “And every time he thought of those two words, he thought of Belisa Crepusculario, and his senses were
            inflamed with the memory of her feral scent, her fiery heat, the whisper of her hair, and her sweet mint
            breath in his ear, until he began to go around like a sleepwalker, and his men realized that he might die
            before he ever sat in the presidential chair.”(TWO WORDS, 1989, P. 6) </p>

          <p> Despite the inherent magical approach of Isabelle Allande in her work, there is some form of truth in the
            fact that there is power in one’s words. You may never truly know how a simple phrase can affect someone’s
            life. She highlights its ability to change people’s perceptions and views in life just like what happened to
            the Colonel. Belisa knew that the Colonel is the loneliest man in the world, one grief-stricken by the state
            of the war and the country under its maleficent grasp, she knew what the Colonel really wants, and the two
            words she gave him set the Colonel’s mind into contemplation and succoring him to decide what direction he
            truly wants to direct his life towards to. </p>

          <p> “There was more than to it than that, however, she felt the urge to help him because she felt a throbbing
            warmth beneath her skin, a powerful desire to touch that man, to fondle him, to clasp him in her arms.”(TWO
            WORDS, 1989, p.4). </p>

          <p> “She had been waiting. She picked up her inkwell, folded the canvas of her small stall, arranged her shawl
            around her shoulders, and without a word took her place behind El Mulato’s saddle.”(TWO WORDS, 1989, p.7).
          </p>

          <p> In conclusion, a formalist analysis of “Two Words” seemingly showed the true meaning of what the story was
            trying to decipher. Perceiving language as a powerful tool to change people’s lives and to shape someone’s
            destiny. And that the words have the power to shape someone’s fate. Mysterious as the words can be, that
            even ferocious and voracious soul can be tamed with words coming from the person he fell in love with. </p>
